## Why This Extension?

Excel's Power Query editor is **painful to use**. This extension brings the **power of VS Code** to Power Query development:

- üöÄ **Modern Architecture**: No COM/ActiveX dependencies that break with VS Code updates
- üîß **Reliable**: Direct Excel file parsing - no Excel installation required  
- üåê **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Instant startup, no waiting for COM objects
- üé® **Beautiful**: Syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and proper formatting

## The Problem This Solves

**Original EditExcelPQM extension** (and Excel's built-in editor) suffer from:
- ‚ùå Breaks with every VS Code update (COM/ActiveX issues)
- ‚ùå Windows-only, requires Excel installed
- ‚ùå Leaves Excel zombie processes  
- ‚ùå Unreliable startup (popup dependencies)
- ‚ùå Terrible editing experience

**This extension** provides:
- ‚úÖ Update-resistant architecture
- ‚úÖ Works without Excel installed
- ‚úÖ Clean, reliable operation
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility
- ‚úÖ Modern VS Code integration

## Features

- **Extract Power Query from Excel**: Right-click on `.xlsx` or `.xlsm` files to extract Power Query definitions to `.m` files
- **Edit with Syntax Highlighting**: Full Power Query M language support with syntax highlighting
- **Auto-Sync**: Watch `.m` files for changes and automatically sync back to Excel
- **No COM Dependencies**: Works without Excel installed, uses direct file parsing
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Usage

### Extract Power Query from Excel

1. Right-click on an Excel file (`.xlsx` or `.xlsm`) in the Explorer
2. Select "Extract Power Query from Excel"
3. The extension will create `.m` files in a new folder next to your Excel file
4. Open the `.m` files to edit your Power Query code

### Edit Power Query Code

- `.m` files have full syntax highlighting for Power Query M language
- IntelliSense support for Power Query functions and keywords
- Proper indentation and bracket matching

### Sync Changes Back to Excel

1. Open a `.m` file
2. Right-click in the editor and select "Sync Power Query to Excel"
3. Or use the sync button in the editor toolbar
4. The extension will update the corresponding Excel file

### Auto-Watch for Changes

1. Open a `.m` file
2. Right-click and select "Watch Power Query File"
3. The extension will automatically sync changes to Excel when you save
4. A status bar indicator shows the watching status

## Commands

- `Excel Power Query: Extract from Excel` - Extract Power Query definitions from Excel file (creates `filename_PowerQuery.m` in same folder)
- `Excel Power Query: Sync to Excel` - Sync current .m file back to Excel
- `Excel Power Query: Sync & Delete` - Sync .m file to Excel and delete the .m file (with confirmation)
- `Excel Power Query: Watch File` - Start watching current .m file for automatic sync on save
- `Excel Power Query: Stop Watching` - Stop watching current file
- `Excel Power Query: Raw Extraction (Debug)` - Extract all Excel content for debugging

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.96.0 or later
- No Excel installation required (uses direct file parsing)

## Known Limitations

- Currently supports basic Power Query extraction (advanced features coming soon)
- Excel file backup is created automatically before modifications
- Some complex Power Query features may not be fully supported yet

## Development

This extension is built with:
- TypeScript
- xlsx library for Excel file parsing
- chokidar for file watching
- esbuild for bundling

### Building from Source

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## Credits and Attribution

This extension uses the excellent [excel-datamashup](https://github.com/Vladinator/excel-datamashup) library by [Vladinator](https://github.com/Vladinator) for robust Excel Power Query extraction. The excel-datamashup library is licensed under GPL-3.0 and provides the core functionality for parsing Excel DataMashup binary formats.

**Special thanks to:**
- **[Vladinator](https://github.com/Vladinator)** for creating the excel-datamashup library that makes reliable Power Query extraction possible
- The Power Query community for feedback and inspiration

This VS Code extension adds the user interface, file management, and editing workflow on top of the excel-datamashup parsing engine.

## ü§ù **Recommended Extensions**

This extension works great with **[Excel Viewer by GrapeCity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GrapeCity.gc-excelviewer)** which displays Excel files natively in VS Code. Together they provide:

- **View Excel files** directly in VS Code (supports .xlsx, .xlsm)
- **Edit Power Query** in the same workspace
- **Seamless workflow** without leaving VS Code

*The Excel Viewer will be automatically suggested when you install this extension.*
