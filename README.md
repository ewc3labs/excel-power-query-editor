## ü§î Why Use Excel Power Query Editor?
Let‚Äôs be honest: Excel‚Äôs built-in Power Query editor is... not great. It‚Äôs slow, clunky, Windows-only, and the Advanced Editor is barely an editor at all. We got tired of losing work to random syntax errors, fighting with popups, and being told we could only edit ONE query at a time‚Äîwhile Excel locks up the rest of your workflow. So we built the tool we wanted: fast, reliable, and actually respects your time.
**Excel Power Query Editor** gives you:
- A modern, cross-platform development experience in VS Code
- Clean, reliable M code editing with full references and context
- Fast, safe workflows with no dependency on Excel installation
- Professional logging and backup so you never lose work
- A little EWC3 Labs attitude ‚Äî because dev tools should respect your time
