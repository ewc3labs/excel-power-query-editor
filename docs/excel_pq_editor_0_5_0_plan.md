   - Tests were 63/63 passing mid-session
   - Now `toggleWatch` command timing out after 2000ms
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate any changes until resolved
   - **Root Cause**: Likely file watcher cleanup deadlock

2. **🚨 Windows File Watching Crisis** (P0 - PRODUCTION)
   - Triple watcher system causing 4+ sync events per save
   - File creation triggers immediate unwanted sync
   - Excessive backup creation degrading performance
   - **Root Cause**: Dev container workarounds harmful on native Windows

3. **⚠️ Data Integrity Risk** (P1 - CORRUPTION)
   - Metadata headers not stripped before Excel sync
   - Risk of corrupting Excel DataMashup with comment content
   - **Evidence**: Headers like `// Power Query from: file.xlsx` reaching Excel
   - **Impact**: Potential production data corruption

---

## � IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN - CRITICAL PATH TO STABLE v0.5.0

### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (Day 1 - 4-6 hours)

#### 🔥 P0: Fix Test Suite Regression
**Issue**: `toggleWatch` command timing out, blocking all validation
**Actions**:
1. Investigate file watcher cleanup in watch commands
2. Check for async/await deadlocks in `toggleWatch` implementation  
3. Validate test timeout vs actual operation times
4. Consider test environment isolation issues

**Success Criteria**: All 63 tests passing consistently

#### 🚨 P0: Implement Platform-Specific File Watching
**Issue**: Windows overwhelmed by dev container optimization
**Actions**:
1. Add platform detection: `isDevContainer`, `isWindows`, `isMacOS`
2. **Windows Strategy**: Single Chokidar watcher, 2000ms debounce, no backup watchers
3. **Dev Container Strategy**: Keep current triple watcher with polling
4. **Prevent creation sync**: Only watch user edits, ignore file creation events

**Success Criteria**: Single sync event per Windows file save

### Phase 2: Data Integrity Protection (Day 2 - 3-4 hours)

#### ⚠️ P1: Fix Header Stripping Before Excel Sync
**Issue**: Metadata headers reaching Excel DataMashup
**Actions**:
1. Enhance header removal regex to catch ALL comment lines
2. Validate clean M code before sync (only `section` and below)
3. Add pre-sync content validation pipeline
4. Test round-trip integrity with various header formats

**Success Criteria**: No comment pollution in Excel files

#### 📋 P1: Validate Data Round-Trip Safety
**Actions**:
1. Test extraction → edit → sync → re-extract cycle
2. Verify Excel file integrity after sync operations
3. Validate DataMashup binary content purity
4. Test with both small and large Excel files

**Success Criteria**: Perfect round-trip with no data corruption

### Phase 3: User Experience Polish (Day 3 - 2-3 hours)

#### 🔧 P2: Activate Migration System
**Issue**: Users not benefiting from new logging system
**Actions**:
1. **COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING AUDIT COMPLETED** - See `docs/LOGGING_AUDIT_v0.5.0.md`
   - **96.6% of logging** (86/89 instances) NOT using log-level awareness
   - **10 direct console.error calls** bypass system entirely
   - **Massive performance impact** - all verbose content always logs
2. **Implement systematic log-level refactoring**:
   - Phase 1: Fix 10 direct console.error calls (P0 - 2 hours)  
   - Phase 2: Fix 40 high-impact calls in extraction/sync (P1 - 3 hours)
   - Phase 3: Fix remaining 36 calls in watching/activation (P2 - 2 hours)
3. Force `getEffectiveLogLevel()` call during activation ✅ (Already implemented)
4. Convert high-volume functions to use new log level filtering 🔄 (Systematic plan ready)
5. Test migration notification UX ✅ (Working correctly)
6. Validate settings update behavior ✅ (Working correctly)

## 📊 TECHNICAL DEBT ANALYSIS

### Root Cause Analysis of Late-Discovery Issues

1. **Platform Assumption Gap**: 
   - **Problem**: Optimized for dev container edge case, didn't validate on primary platform (Windows)
   - **Learning**: Must test all solutions on target platforms, not just development environment

2. **Integration vs Unit Testing Gap**:
   - **Problem**: File watching behavior differs dramatically between test mocks and real file systems
   - **Learning**: Need integration tests that validate actual file system events

3. **Incremental Development Blindness**:
   - **Problem**: Working solutions became problematic when combined
   - **Learning**: Regular integration testing throughout development, not just at end

### Strategic Architecture Improvements Needed

#### 1. Platform Abstraction Layer
```typescript
interface PlatformStrategy {
  createFileWatcher(file: string): FileWatcher;
  getDebounceMs(): number;
  shouldUseBackupWatchers(): boolean;
}

class WindowsStrategy implements PlatformStrategy { /* ... */ }
class DevContainerStrategy implements PlatformStrategy { /* ... */ }
```

#### 2. Content Validation Pipeline
```typescript
function validateMCodeForSync(content: string): { clean: string; warnings: string[] } {
  // Remove headers, validate syntax, ensure only M code
}
```

#### 3. Event Deduplication System
```typescript
class SyncEventManager {
  private lastSyncHash: Map<string, string> = new Map();
  
  shouldSync(file: string, content: string): boolean {
    // Hash-based change detection
  }
}
```
