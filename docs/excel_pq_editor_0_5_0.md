## Excel Power Query Editor v0.5.0 Release Plan

### üöÄ Major Goals (Narrative)

v0.5.0 is the first polish-and-harden release now that the extension has crossed 100 installs. It focuses on eliminating core usability issues, improving onboarding docs, fixing test harness limitations, and preparing the repo for public contributions and continued growth. The goal is to make it frictionless for first-time users and robust for day-to-day use in version-controlled Excel Power Query development.

### ‚úÖ Critical Bugs (Must-Fix Before Release)

#### üï±Ô∏è Right-click handler not registering on sidebar

- VS Code API does not trigger context menu commands when `.m` file is clicked in Explorer unless editor has focus
- üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Adjust `when` clauses and activation logic so file tree clicks also initialize command targets

#### ‚öôÔ∏è `settings.json` ignored in test harness

- Tests currently can't load user/workspace settings, breaking settings-dependent features
- üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Inject mocked `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration()` for test environment
- üîπ Move `test` folder to repo root (was under `src/`) to align with standard layout

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è CoPilot Agent mode causes triple sync

- Save ‚Üí Sync (expected)
- Agent diff ‚Üí Sync
- Accept diff ‚Üí Sync again
- üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Add debounce, or dedupe within {configurable}ms using file hash/timestamp (don't sync if hash matches)

#### üìÑ Silent failure on open Excel file

- If Excel locks the file, sync fails with no UI warning
- üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Detect locked file via try/catch or fs.open with error codes; show warning or retry
- üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Configurable watch Excel file for availability, write after debounce delay.

### üîß New Features

- `sync.openExcelAfterWrite`: If enabled, launches Excel after sync
- `watch.backup.maxFiles`: Sets retention cap for auto-backups
- `sync.debounceMs`: Configurable debounce delay before sync
- `watch.checkExcelWriteable`: If true, re-checks Excel file write access before sync
- **Apply Recommended Defaults command**: New command in Command Palette to set smart recommended defaults after upgrade or first install

> New settings are introduced in 0.5.0 with sensible defaults. Users who installed before 0.5.0 may wish to run the new "Apply Recommended Defaults" command from the Command Palette to update their settings.
