# Beta Downloads

Pre-release builds, ahead of the Marketplace.

**Automatic publishing to the Marketplace is currently switched off**, so the releases page is where
the newest build lives - not just betas. See [Installation](Installation.md) for the ordinary route.

## 🚀 Quick Install

[![Latest Pre-release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ewc3labs/excel-power-query-editor?include_prereleases&label=latest%20beta)](https://github.com/ewc3labs/excel-power-query-editor/releases)

**Reliable method:**
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/ewc3labs/excel-power-query-editor/releases)
2. Download the latest `.vsix` file from a "Pre-release" entry
3. Install: `code --install-extension excel-power-query-editor-*.vsix`

## 🔄 Auto-Update Script

Save this as `update-excel-pq-beta.sh` (or `.bat` for Windows):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Download and install latest Excel Power Query Editor beta

echo "🔍 Fetching latest beta release..."
LATEST_URL=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ewc3labs/excel-power-query-editor/releases | jq -r '.[0].assets[0].browser_download_url')

if [[ "$LATEST_URL" != "null" ]]; then
    echo "📦 Downloading: $LATEST_URL"
    curl -L -o excel-power-query-editor-beta.vsix "$LATEST_URL"
    
    echo "🚀 Installing..."
    code --install-extension excel-power-query-editor-beta.vsix
    
    echo "✅ Beta installed! Restart VS Code to use."
    rm excel-power-query-editor-beta.vsix
else
    echo "❌ Could not fetch latest release"
